## Introduction
Parking can often be a challenging task, especially in tight or unfamiliar spaces. To address this, we aim to create Romică, a robot designed to assist users in parking vehicles safely and efficiently. Equipped with a distance sensor, Romică will help drivers determine their proximity to obstacles by providing real-time feedback. When a vehicle gets closer to an obstacle, Romică will signal the user to stop. Conversely, if the obstacle is far enough, it will indicate that the user can move forward.

This project combines hardware and software design to develop an accessible and user-friendly solution to enhance parking safety and convenience.

## Overview
TBD - The block diagram will illustrate the robot's main hardware components, communication pathways (Bluetooth, WiFi), and software interactions.

## Hardware Design
TBD - This section will contain data about the components used in creating the project.
  
## Software Design
The software design for Romică is centered around efficient, reliable communication between the robot's hardware components and the end user. The project is developed using PlatformIO on Visual Studio Code, a robust and feature-rich environment for embedded systems development.

## Final Results
TBD - This section will document the robot's performance, including its speed, responsiveness, and user feedback.

## Conclusions
TBD - The conclusions will reflect on the challenges faced, solutions implemented, and potential improvements.
